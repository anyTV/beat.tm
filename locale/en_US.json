	"faq1": "1. What is BEAT?",
	"ans1": "Video creators on platforms like YouTube, Twitch, and Hitbox are always looking for great music to use in their productions and music artists are always looking for methods of getting their music out and heard by the public. BEAT solves both of these problems by bringing both video creators and music artists together!",
	"faq2": "2. What does BEAT provide?",
	"ans2": "BEAT provides a music distribution platform for music artists and a large library of music for use by video creators. The music is \"fingerprinted\" in our CMS (Content Management System) so when it is used in a video production, the artist is given proper credit as well as a portion of the revenue generated by the amount of views the video receives. The video creator that chose the free music track is guaranteed to never receive a copyright strike and the revenue that the music artist receives is not detracted from the video creators portion of revenue, rather the network's portion of revenue.",
	"faq3": "3. How does BEAT provide?",

	"faq5": "5. Can non-Freedom! partners use BEAT music in their videos?",
	"ans5": "Non-Freedom! partners can use BEAT music in their videos, but the videos that contain the music are subject to revenue claims.",

	"ans6": "Music artists that sign with BEAT have access to a form where they can send in tracks to be uploaded to the Freedom! dashboard.",
	"faq7": "7. What happens if I leave Freedom!?",
	"ans7": "If you are a Freedom! partner that used a BEAT song in one or more of your videos and you leave the Freedom! network, none of the videos in which you used the music will be affected. All future videos after leaving the Freedom! network are subject to revenue claims.",
	"faq8": "8. Can I use BEAT music in both my videos and livestreams?",
